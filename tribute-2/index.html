	<h2>A little about Steve Jobs</h2>
	<section class="about">
		<p>Steven Paul Jobs was an American inventor, designer and entrepreneur who was the co-founder, chief executive and chairman of Apple Computer. Apple's revolutionary products, which include the iPod, iPhone and iPad, are now seen as dictating the evolution of modern technology. Born in 1955 to two University of Wisconsin graduate students who gave him up for adoption, Jobs was smart but directionless, dropping out of college and experimenting with different pursuits before co-founding Apple with Steve Wozniak in 1976. Jobs left the company in 1985, launching Pixar Animation Studios, then returned to Apple more than a decade later. Jobs died in 2011 following a long battle with pancreatic cancer.</p><img alt="A young Steve jobs at Apple Inc." src="img/steve_jobs_young-min.png">

			<h2>My thoughts on Steve Jobs</h2>
			<p>Steve jobs is an amazing man, I never thought I would utter such a statement. My opinion of Mr. Jobs for a long time was based on accounts of his interactions with people (mostly negative) and my belief in a restrictive nature of how Apple allowed consumers to use these products. My opinion began to change after watch the movie Jobs the one staring Ashton Kutcher. I started reading more about Steve and came to an opinion that he can be a harsh and difficult person, but I believe this is because of his passion and love for what he did. Mr. Jobs inspires me even though he is no longer with us; to strive and spend my day doing what I love, he is the reason I upon graduating college made the choice to teach myself web development instead I following my I.T degree. I cannot personally thank Mr. Jobs for the courage he has given my to pursue my dreams I can only go after these passions with all my heart. This is why I admire Steve Jobs. Below is one of the must inspiring speaches I have ever heard.</p>
