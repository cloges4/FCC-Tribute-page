        <p class="thoughts">
            Steve jobs is an amazing man, I never thought I would utter such a statement.
            My opinion of Mr. Jobs for a long time was based on accounts of his interactions with people (mostly negative) and my belief in a restrictive nature of how Apple allowed consumers to use these products. My opinion began to change after watch the movie Jobs the one staring Ashton Kutcher. I started reading more about Steve and came to an opinion that he can be a harsh and difficult person, but I believe this is because of his passion and love for what he did. Mr. Jobs inspires me even though he is no longer with us to strive and spend my day doing what I love, he is the reason I upon graduating college I made the choice to teach myself web development instead I following my I.T degree. I cannot personally thank Mr. Jobs for the courage he has given my to pursue my dreams I can only go after these passions with all my heart. This is why I admire Steve Jobs.
